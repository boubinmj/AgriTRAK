**The OneWire library is a premade library used for interfacing the DS18B20 temperature
sensor

**Temp_WaterLvl is the working code that makes use of the temp sensor and the water level 
sensor

**try3 is the base code I used for the temp sensor that makes use of the OneWire library.
I built off of this code for the Temp_WaterLvl code.
